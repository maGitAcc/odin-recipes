    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p> 
        A classic lasagna recipe involves layering wide, flat pasta sheets with a rich meat-based tomato sauce and a creamy cheese mixture, then baking the dish until bubbly and golden. The meat sauce typically starts with a slow-simmered bolognese featuring ground beef, Italian sausage, tomatoes, herbs, and aromatics like garlic and onion. The cheese component provides a creamy contrast, usually a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese, often mixed with an egg to help it set properly. The final assembly sees the dish built layer by layer—sauce, noodles, cheese, repeat—culminating in a top layer of sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and parmesan before being baked in the oven.

    <h2> Meat Sauce Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Ground Meat:</strong> Typically a combination of lean ground beef and sweet Italian sausage for rich flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Aromatics:</strong> Diced onion and minced garlic are essential for the flavor base.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tomato Products:</strong> A mix of crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste provides depth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasonings:</strong> Dried basil, oregano, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper (some recipes also add fresh parsley, fennel seeds, or a pinch of sugar to balance acidity).
        </li>
        <li>
             <strong>Olive Oil:</strong> For cooking the aromatics and meat.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cheese Filling Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Ricotta Cheese:</strong> Whole-milk ricotta is preferred for a rich texture (cottage cheese can be used as a substitute).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Eggs:</strong> Beaten eggs help bind the ricotta mixture together so it doesn't run out when sliced.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Parmasan Cheese:</strong> Freshly grated for a bold, savory flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mozarella Cheese:</strong> Shredded mozzarella provides the classic gooey, melty layers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasonings:</strong> Parsley, salt, pepper, and sometimes a pinch of nutmeg for a traditional touch. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Noodle and Misc. Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Lasagna Noodles:</strong> You will need approximately 9 to 12 noodles, either the traditional kind (which need boiling first) or oven-ready/no-boil sheets.
        </li>

        <li>
           <strong>Water (optional):</strong> Some "easy" recipes call for a small amount of water poured into the baking dish edges to help the no-boil noodles cook. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Preheat</strong> your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
        </li>

        <li>
           <strong>Cook Meat Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, cook 1 lb of ground beef or a mix of beef and Italian sausage with chopped onions and garlic until the meat is browned. Drain any excess fat. Stir in a large jar of marinara sauce and simmer for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook Noodles:</strong> While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (tender yet firm to the bite). Drain the noodles and lay them flat to prevent sticking. (Alternatively, use oven-ready/no-boil noodles and skip this step).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Cheese Mixture:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper. Stir until well mixed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble Layers:</strong> Begin layering in your prepared baking dish:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lay 3-4 noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly if needed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread about 1/3 of the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spoon about 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce over the cheese layer
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle a generous layer of shredded mozzarella.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat the layers twice more (noodles, ricotta mixture, sauce, mozzarella).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finish with a final layer of noodles, the remaining sauce, and the last of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                </li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Brown Top and Rest:</strong> Uncover the lasagna and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the cheese is melted, golden brown, and bubbly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Let the lasagna rest on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This is a crucial step to prevent it from becoming a soupy mess. 
        </li>
    </ol>
