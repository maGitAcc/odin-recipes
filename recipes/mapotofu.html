    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p> 
        To make mapo tofu, first prepare the ingredients: drain a block of soft tofu and cut it into 1-inch cubes,then gently blanch the cubes in a pot of salted simmering water for a few minutes before draining. Meanwhile, in a wok or large pan over high heat, add oil and cook ground pork, breaking it up with a spatula until it is crispy and the fat has rendered. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in minced ginger and garlic, cooking until the oil turns a vibrant red and the aromatics are fragrant. Next, pour in chicken or vegetable stock
        and add soy sauce and a pinch of sugar, bringing the mixture to a simmer. Carefully add the blanched tofu cubes to the wok and simmer for a few minutes, allowing them to absorb the rich flavors. Gradually mix in a cornstarch slurry (cornstarch dissolved in water) to thicken the sauce to a glossy consistency. Finish the dish by stirring in chopped
        green onions and a drizzle of sesame oil, then transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with freshly ground Sichuan peppercorn powder for the authentic numbing sensation. Serve immediately with hot steamed rice.
